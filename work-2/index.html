      <p style="text-indent: 40px">In class assignments this time around were definitely harder and more detail oriented compared to the first work in progress submission. A lot of them were done in groups, which I found very interesting because I always considered stuff like coding and Photoshop to be pretty individual tasks. In terms of actually doing the in-class assignments, I approached them with a lot of cautious optimism. Cautious because I didn't really know how to use any of the software (Photoshop, Audacity, etc.) but optimistic because the entire point of this class is to learn new things and to be introduced to this type of software. Also cautious because anytime you are working with a group of people you don't really know, ideas are going to be contradicting and so is different people's skill level. The amount of creativity that is needed to do projects like this is a lot more than I ever considered. I knew it would require some imagination, but sometimes I did find it difficult to come up with design ideas and choices in such a short amount of time.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px">One of the main revisions I did to my previous work was fixing typos. Most of the time I try to type things out in Word before transferring them to my Github page to try and minimize the amount of spelling mistakes I have, but even then they still seem to exist. I feel like every time I read over my website I find a small editing mistake that I missed previously, and going forward it is just a matter of making sure I pay more attention to what I am typing and to proofread more thoroughly. I also changed around some of the wording in my skills assignment posts, because when rereading it, it just didn't make that much sense. I also moved the finished product GIFs from my skills assignment to their own separate page so I have the option to add more GIFs as I make them without them being overcrowded by a longer text post. I also noticed that one of my previous arrows that I used in my skills assignment did not go to the correct page, so I made sure to fix that so they are all in order now. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px">One of the main things I have added since the first post was a border around my text posts. I think by adding this it adds a sense of direction, and shows exactly where the reader is supposed to look on the page. I made sure it had curved edges and wasn't a solid line because I think it fits with the theme of the website more. I don't want anything on here to be taken too seriously and professional. I wanted the vibe of it to be more of a blogging type website that was easy on the eyes with the darker color scheme and no harsh lines. One of the biggest design elements I implemented into my website was having previous and next arrows to shuffle through the works instead of just providing links at the top or bottom of the screen. I believe that by doing this it cleans up the website and keeps it minimalistic instead of having a bunch of random links thrown about. Also, when adding my class work to the page, I tried multiple times to embed the audacity sound project into my website and just have it as a music player on the page instead of being linked to a different website, but I could not figure it out. I tried multiple different websites ideas and nothing worked, so trying to figure this out would be something to do looking forward. </p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px">Looking back at my first submission reflection post, I realized that I haven't changed a whole lot of design choices, but I think that that is a good thing. It shows that my original idea is really what I wanted and that I am confident enough in it to maintain the general idea. Looking forward, I want to try and add pictures to my 'About Me' page just so people on the website can actually know who is talking (or typing, I guess) to them. I still haven't learned as much about Photoshop as I would've hoped, but I feel like it is impossible to know everything. I definitely focused in different subjects on the platform than I thought I would. I originally thought I would be more interested in editing pictures, but I realized that I was more interested in making GIFs. I definitely feel more confident in my HTML and CSS but it is still a learning process and Google has been my best friend during this class. Going forward, I think just keeping my website minimalistic and clean is the best way to go. I am not the best at this stuff, nor will I ever be, so I think keeping it simple is the best idea. I definitely want to make more GIFs and continue to learn more about Photoshop in the future. </p>
