    <p><center><div style="overflow: auto; width:800px; height:400px;"><div class="boxed">For the submission post I decided to revamp the movie poster genre project we did with a group in class. Originally we did a High School Musical poster and attempted to change it to a horror movie poster. I decided to stick with the original plan, just did it in a different way. I changed the overall color of the background curtain to black, and changed "High School Musical" to "Hell School Musical." i made it look like they were jumping into a pit of fire, and I also added scary mouths and devil horns onto the people. Photoshop is still pretty difficult for me, but I think this is a step-up from the original one that I did with the group. It is still the same general concept, but hopefully a bit more refined.</p>
