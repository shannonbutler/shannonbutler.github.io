    <p><center>All of the tedious stuff about the hard work I put into this project starts on the next page, but I wanted to put this first because I think it provides a good perspective on what I've done, and It makes everything else make more sense. I also wanted to include the finished product GIFs on here because that is always fun. But anywayâ€¦.</center></p>

<p><center><div class="boxed">For my skills assignment I choice to tackle the task of making GIFs in Photoshop from videos. I focused on this skill because I am an active blogger on Tumblr, and I am a part of a lot of fandoms. A bunch of people within these communities create and produce their own fan content, including GIFs. I always wanted to be able to do this, but instead I just sat back and endlessly hit the reblog button while I admired other people's work. Besides being able to post my own GIFs and complain about people on the internet stealing my own custom content, having this skill would actually probably help me in a future career. I want to go down the media relations/social media management route professionally. Being able to have some skill in Photoshop would be a beneficial resume booster because that odds that I will use it in a career are pretty high.</p> 
	<p>I have to admit, making GIFs is a lot easier than I expected. I thought it was going to be this super long, strenuous process, but honestly it isn't. At least it isn't when referring to just the bare basics of how to make a GIF. I did a lot of my independent study in my bed because my bedroom is so small that I don't have a desk, but I am most comfortable in my room so it worked out. I think with what I was trying to teach myself, I had to make sure I was comfortable because I think with Photoshop it is extremely easy to get frustrated. There are just so many things that are possible to do, so trying to learn it all in one go is extremely difficult. Because of this, I found it much easier to use Youtube tutorials instead of the Lynda.com videos. One main reason being my attention span is significantly low when it comes to really long videos, AKA the Lynda ones. I definitely found it more helpful to explore the topics that were offered in the 4 hour long videos and pick and choose what would be helpful to me. In the future, I definitely want to sit down and actually pay thorough attention to what they are saying, but in terms of making a GIF, not all of that information was really needed.</p>
	<p>Sadly, I didn't have anyone I could talk to that knew how to make GIFs on Photoshop, but I did utilize Tumblr and Youtube for this problem. With the personal feel of tumblr blogs and youtube videos, it was a lot easier to listen and read what was being said and then perform it in Photoshop. Especially with the Tumblr tutorials, it felt like a friend was typing something out for me to do because they are very informal, but very effective. As I said, to make the GIFs, I didn't find the Lynda videos useful, and I completely took them out of my original 20 hour plan. Although I will say, that learning how to create a GIF, it does make me a lot more interested in learning the ins and outs of Photoshop. Now that I bought the application to have on my computer, I might as well be able to use it for more than one thing!</p>
	<p>If I could turn back time and start this whole process over, I would probably focus more on the actual editing aspect of Photoshop so I could produce GIFs with cool effects, but I don't think it is crucial enough to what I succeeded in learning. One thing I definitely would change in a heartbeat is my lack of time management. I am HORRIBLE when it comes to managing and organizing my time and work load. I am the queen of procrastination. Don't get me wrong, I got the 20 hours of independent study done, but I definitely waited until the last minute. I mean I was up until late hours of the night watching tutorials. Honestly, it was all worth it, so I can't complain too much.</p>
 <p>Through the multiple Youtube and Tumblr tutorials, I successfully learned how to make a GIF, add text to it with strokes so it is visible to see, and how to sharpen and very simply edit the quality. I used to look at these GIFs all the time while I was scrolling through Tumblr, and now that I can make my own custom content, it completely changes the game. It makes blogging fun again. I have been on Tumblr for probably almost 10 years, so being able to FINALLY upload my own content is honestly pretty rad. I can't wait to spend multiple hours of my day wasting time making GIFs to post on the internet instead of doing the actual school work that I need to be doing!</div></center></p>
