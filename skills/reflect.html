    <p>1. Just working on basic photoshop skills with other people in class was helpful. Getting to see what other people already knew how to do and collaborating on something was useful with getting more familiar with Photoshop.</p>
    <p>2. This video was extremely useful. Not only did it help in learning the basics of Photoshop, but it helped in understanding why everything is the way that it is. It is very in depth and detail oriented. Having this video at my dispense will be useful to look back on if I forget how to do something.</p>
      <p>3. Reading this tutorial took be about a half hour to thoroughly read it and comprehend it. I followed it step by step. Looking ahead, I need to look more into getting videos from youtube saved to my computer and how to actually make image sequences.</p>
      <p>4. This was needed to actually have content to make the gifs out of. I eventually want to post these on my tumblr page, so having content to make them out of will be useful.</p>
      <p>5. This was actually really helpful. It made me realize that making GIFs on photoshop isn't that difficult. I made a really short GIF from some random live photo on my phone. I still have to learn how to edit the videos and then learn how to make a GIF from a much larger clip, but this was cool being able to have a finished product.</p>
      <p>6. I just played around today with stuff that I already learned earlier to gain some more practice. I made another GIF from one of my live pictures that I had from England, nothing fancy.</p>
        <p>7. It was actually a lot easier than I thought to make a GIF from a longer youtube video. It is a very easy few simple steps that I can imagine will eventually become muscle memory for me.</p>
      <p>8. I've made 2 GIFs so far, and I am still getting the hang of it. I need to work on editing them. I want to learn how to change the colors and add text and what not.</p>
      <p>9. This was probably the hardest thing yet. More because there are just a lot more steps than anything else. But now that I know how to do it, it isn't too bad.</p>
      <p>10. This was pretty simple. It is nice to see a preview of the gif and mess around with the colors and the dither before actually saving it to post.</p>
        <p>11. Animating a still photo was probably the hardest thing. I would post it somewhere here but it was too big to save as a GIF, so I honestly didn't know how.</p>
        <p>12. Sharpening GIFs definitely makes them look better. Eventually I will learn how to actually edit them and change color palletes, but I did find out that it is possible to download actions off of Tumblr that will do those for you. I believe that most people do this instead of actually doing it themselves.</p>
