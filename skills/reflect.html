    <p>1. Just working on basic photoshop skills with other people in class was helpful. Getting to see what other people already knew how to do and collaborating on something was useful in just getting more familiar with Photoshop.</p>
    <p>2. This video was extremely useful. Not only did it help in learning the basics of Photoshop,but it helped in understanding why everything is the way that it is. It is very in depth and detail oriented. Having this video at my dispense will be useful to look back on if I forget how to do something.</p>
      <p>3. Reading this tutorial took be about a half hour to thoroughly read it and comprehend it. I followed it step by step. Looking ahead, I need to look more into getting videos from youtube saved to my computer and how to actually make image sequences.</p>
