      <p style="text-indent: 40px">I chose to take this class solely because it was an elective option for the certificates I am pursuing and it seemed like it would be hopefully interesting. I had literally no background in coding or digital media at all, besides the fact that I frequently use social media. Although it is a pretty involved and detail-oriented class, I am actually enjoying it so far. I have realized that having these skills will hopefully give me more options in the professional field, and possibly open my eyes to other opportunities that I otherwise would not have thought of.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px">The assignments we have done so far have been approached pretty cautiously. With not knowing really how to do anything, I almost felt like I was setting myself up to fail. Coding can be extremely confusing in the beginning but I slowly feel like I am starting to get the hang of it. The more I work on the website and google things and watch the Lynda videos, the easier it is becoming to understand what I am actually doing. In terms of this assignment, I found myself remembering more and more things and not having to look up as much stuff as I did previously. Don't get me wrong, there were still plenty of things I had to google, but being able to do at least some stuff just from memory alone was pretty rewarding.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px">Looking back at what I wrote in the assignment for week 4, there is a lot I have changed from what I described in that assignment. Since I wrote that, I have completely changed to color scheme from teal to a very calming and soothing color scheme with darker greens and blues, with accents of dark pink. I think it fits the vibe of what I was going for better than the teal colors. I also have relocated the menu to the top of the screen, and it is static, so when someone scrolls down it shouldn't disappear. When you hover over the links, it changes color to make it easier to see what you are clicking on. I think it cleans up the website by having the menu up and out of the way of the rest of the website's content. I changed the fonts to something more relaxed and laid back. My goal is to look more into moving around the placement of the texts on the website, instead of having them just kind of thrown into the middle of the page. Also adding pictures where appropriate is something else I want to attempt in the future.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px">Going forward in the class, I am very interested in learning how to correctly use Photoshop, or at least the basics of it. I think by being able to properly use Photoshop, it can help advance my website by being able to put different pictures and graphics on it. I grew up around people that were very skilled in the subject, but I never actually learned myself. One thing within Photoshop I would like to learn is how to crop and edit photos efficiently. I have a significant amount of travel photos from my time abroad, and being able to edit them correctly and eventually post them would be ideal. Another thing within Photoshop would be how to remove unwanted people or things from the backgrounds of pictures. As I said, it would be very beneficial with all of the travel photos I have from the last few months. Photoshop also offers the ability for make gifs, and I would really enjoy learning how to do that. I am a frequent Tumblr user, so being able to upload my own original edited content would be nice. I also think Photoshop is beneficial in general in terms of web design. If used correctly, it would allow me to make a mock-up of a website so it would be easier to plan what I want to do instead of jumping straight into coding.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px">Besides Photoshop, just fine tuning my skills within HTML and CSS would be ideal. As I mentioned earlier, I am a frequent Tumblr user, and when it comes to the themes for the blogs, it has a lot to do with coding and HTML. Having a better understanding of what was actually happening behind the scenes of websites would be beneficial to me in my leisure and hopefully my future career. I want to do something along the lines of media and social media, so having a better understanding of the websites I will be working with will be rewarding and profitable.</p>
