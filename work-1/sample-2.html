    <div class="belowmenu"><p><center>I haven’t done much yet to the style of my website, but so far I have played around with the colors and spacing. I have centered everything because I find it to be more pleasing to the eye and easier to navigate. I also changed the color scheme to teal. The background is still white, but the header color and the boxes that I added around the hyperlinks are teal. I went with this because I want to have a more laid back, sort of calming website. If possible I want to figure out how to change the boxes that I put around the hyperlinks in the menu to have more of a rounded edge. I spend most of my time on Tumblr, and I appreciate how there are no harsh lines, and has a blue color scheme. It is very calm and collected, with almost an “I don’t care” type of vibe. Tumblr is very inviting and easy to navigate, so having my own website achieve that would be ideal.</center></p>
	<p><center>I plan to change the fonts and play around with those because I find times new roman to be too posh and sophisticated for my liking. I don’t want anything on my website to be too harsh or intense. As I said, I am going for the vibe that Tumblr has. I wouldn’t mind trying to move things around, maybe place the menu on the side. I also want to try changing the background color of the website, and finding a color scheme that is soothing to the eye that doesn’t take away from the actual content of the website. I want the website to reflect me as an author, and I think keeping it pretty low key and simple would do that. Also, the intended audience for a website like Tumblr is younger, more hipster-ish people, so if I had a blog I would want it to be inviting for them. The purpose of the website would to just be a place to relax and hang out and not have to think so much, and that’s what I would be trying to do with the style of it.
