    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Three words to describe Shannon would probably be sarcastic, independent, and blunt. Sounds approachable, right? But really, she has a great heart and is loyal and all that stuff, she just can be hard to understand sometimes. If you are looking for a friend that will tell you like it is and let you know if that dress makes you look fat instead of lying and saying you look wonderful, then Shannon is your girl. She is the type of person that likes to use big words such as fascinating, egregious, or platonic when describing mundane situations to make herself sound smarter. She spends most of her time alone watching British Youtubers (which would explain the insane sarcastic humor she possesses) or rewatching old episodes of Glee because she has an unhealthy obsession with Darren Criss. If you want to read a blog basically commenting on what everyone in the world is doing wrong and what an annoying 21 year old thinks everyone should do about the large issues happening on earth, then stick around because thereâ€™s going to be a lot of that on here!</p>
