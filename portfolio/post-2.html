<p>The look of my website was really important to me. I wanted something that was very calming, relaxing and inviting in terms of the color scheme. I chose the darker background colors with the pops of lighter pinks and greens to add contrast while still staying in that warm and comfortable color scheme that I was striving for. I wanted to do it this way because I think these colors fit the bill of being a more personal website. Same thing with the font choices. I wanted something fun that looked like someone's real handwriting so it appeared more relaxed and natural. If I was making this a professional website that I was going to show to future employers, I definitely would've stuck with a more monochrome, white website with more subtle accents of color because I would want it to focus more on my work experience and abilities instead of focusing on the more personal side of me. I wouldn't want the colors to distract from being hired for a job. </p>
