    <h2><center>Let's Reflect</center></h2>
<p><center><div style="overflow: auto; width:800px; height:400px;"><div class="boxed">In my opinion, the term 'revision' is all about trying. It is trying to get better, and focusing on what you can do to make something nicer. It doesn't necessarily mean that whatever is  redone is perfect and amazing, I think it means that you put in effort and hard work to try and get better at what you are doing. Nothing I have done over the course of this semester is anywhere near perfect, but there is definitely noticeable progress, and I think that is what is important.</p>
  <p>This entire time I have kept with the idea that my website was a personal, blog type website instead of a professional website like some of the other people in the class were doing. I wanted everything on it to be light hearted and fun, instead of plain and professional. By keeping it a personal website, I was able to add some style in my type of voice. I am extremely sarcastic and being able to put just a tiny bit of that into some of my writings has made this whole process a lot easier. It allowed me to look at the projects and assignments for this class in a more exciting way instead of just looking at them as homework. Because of this, my "target audience" if I was actually using this website for other people to see would be people my age that are interested in getting to know me and my personality. So having my own personal voice shine through all of the writings and assignments was super important for the work that I have done this semester. The piece of work that I think shows my personality the most is definitely the about me section on the website. I know that is the whole point of this little paragraph, to explain to my audience who I am, but it really sets the tone for who's website they are about to enter and what they can expect from me. But it isn't just text that portray my personality to this imaginary audience. My website is truly multimodal, which "describes how we combine multiple different ways of communicating in everyday life." (Arola, Sheppard, Ball 1). My website has pictures and GIFs along with text. Some of the GIFs even have text one them. These allow my likes and interests to shine through. The visual mode was also a big aspect of my website. This is referring to what the website actually looks like, and what the readers will see. The visual mode includes the color, layout, style, size, and perspective (Arola, Sheppard, Ball 6). I really wanted to stick with a darker, more serene, warm and welcoming layout for my website. I wanted it to feel inviting and if I actually turned it into a blog, something that people would feel comfortable spending their time on and reading multiple paragraphs of texts. I really wanted anyone to be able to access this website.</p>
  <p>It was really important when deciding it was better to type something out and when a picture or a GIF was just enough. Mostly all of the visual modes I put on the website were because of other projects in the class, but it was still a decision on whether I should use text to describe any of them or if the picture/GIF was just enough. There are different strengths and weaknesses of different media, and taking into consideration these affordances when deciding how to design my website was really important (Arola, Sheppard, Ball 15).</p>
  <p>I really didn't get my work peer reviewed that much by anyone in the class, or I guess no one really looked at my website at all. I did show my GIFs to the class and my audacity project, but there weren't any strong critiques that made me feel like there was a need to really change anything drastically. I personally didn't enjoy the audacity project, I don't really like working with that program, nor did I really enjoy working with just sounds, but it was still nice to be able to produce something that I have never done before. But in terms of the peer reviewed stuff, I did play off of what other people said to other classmates when they showcased their website to the class. After hearing some peoples comments, I really made an emphasis on contrasting colors and fonts. I wanted the colors to be dark and calming, but by adding the pop of brighter pinks and greens, it really provided a nicer contrast and made the website easier to look at and read.</p>
  <p>When editing and revising previous work, it was really more about making something more easily understandable and accessible, and not necessarily about making something perfect. I didn't want anyone looking at my website to be overwhelmed and confused by what they were seeing, I wanted it to be really simple and easy. I think keeping my website simple, minimalistic and approachable was the most important component of this process. Even when playing with different genres and themes, I wanted to still have my style and aesthetic underlying it. This website was a reflection of me, and I wanted that to come across no matter what genre I was experimenting with. This could maybe be considered indirect expression. Being able to express my personality and who I am without directly telling people about it.</p>
  <p>My individual goals going in to this semester were honestly just to create a semblance of a working website that was really the bare minimum. I think I accomplished that and more. I have a specific color scheme, and created borders around my text, a static menu. Previous and next buttons, and even more. I went beyond what I thought I would be able to do. I also feel super accomplished with what I was able to do with my skills assignment and making the GIFs. I'm proud of all of them, but specifically the Kurt Hummel GIF of him saying "calm down, psycho." I think this shows off everything I was able to do within that 20 hour time frame. The coloring and sizing are good, the speed is perfect and there is text on it. It is a good representation of how far I've come, especially when it is compared to one of my first gifs. In the future, I probably won't continue to code websites anymore, it isn't really my style, but I definitely want to continue my work in Photoshop. I forced my mom to let me buy the program for a year, so I might as well get my money's worth! All in all, this class was really rewarding, and it allowed me to see that I really can accomplish something if I just stop being lazy and actually put my mind to it.</p>
