It literally took forever. I kept getting a little blue question mark popping up instead of the picture. Once I finally figured that out, the picture was way too big, it was bigger than my entire computer screen. There was a lot of resizing of the picture and posting it on different websites so I could embed it into the website so it actually fit on the screen. Finally, once I got it to work, I realized that the picture quality dropped. Honestly, after all the trouble I went to do get it there, I am completely fine with it. If this was a professional website or if I was actually using it once this class is over, I would find another picture, but for this purpose I think it is fine. I learned from this that not everything is perfect, and nothing is going to work on the first try, but eventually in the end you will (hopefully) get some positive results. </p>
