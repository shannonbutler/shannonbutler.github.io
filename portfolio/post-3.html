<p>I wanted to compare my High School Musical horror poster that I made in Photoshop with a High School Musical trailer that someone made if this movie was a horror film. I know that they are not the same type of modes, but I really wanted to emphasize how creepy something can become with just editing. The poster I did is changed a lot, but it still has a sense of satire or humor to it. It most likely would not be taken seriously as an actual horror film poster. In contrast though, the first trailer that is in this video shows how easy it would be to make something so light-hearted so dark and creepy. The video really portrays the thriller aspects that are possible when something is edited correctly and the right type of music and what not is added to it. I compared these two things because I think it is important to highlight how different modes can portray different things, even if they are going for the same thing. With more revisions to the poster and better Photoshop skills, I think there is potential to make it more sinister, but I think if I really wanted to portray something scary, I would have to switch modes over to a video and make a trailer instead.</p>
