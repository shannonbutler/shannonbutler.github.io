 <p>This GIF is something that I am particularly proud of. I think this GIF, especially when compared to my previous ones, really shows the progress that I have made since the beginning of the skills project. The coloring is really nice, the speed matches the normal speed of the actual video that the clip is from, and it has text. The best part about it is that it actually loads in a decent time when uploaded to the internet! That was a big problem I had with some of the other GIFs that I made. I just think out of all the GIFs hat I have made, it is the smoothest and cleanest, and it includes all of the elements that I really focused on. In the future I might focusing more on having fading text instead of it being there for the entire gif, and maybe adding some color filters, but other than that I really enjoy looking at this GIF as is.</p>
