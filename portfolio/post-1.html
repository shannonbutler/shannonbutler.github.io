<p><center><div style="overflow: auto; width:800px; height:400px;"><div class="boxed">I think that my 'About Me' section of my website could fall under the genre of satire. It is sarcastic, self-deprecating, and ultimately I'm making fun of myself to express who I am. It really gives a sense of the audience I am trying to reach. If they don't think my 'About Me' blurb is funny, then I really don't think that my imaginary blog would be for them. If I was reimagining this to work in another genre, let's say a professional setting for a website that I would use to apply for jobs, then I definitely would completely change it. I would use more business centric language, take out the sarcasm and self-deprecation, and really have it highlight my strengths in the work place. The 'About Me' section of my website is the very first thing you see when you click on it, so the tone that this sets is really providing a general direction for the rest of the website.</p>
